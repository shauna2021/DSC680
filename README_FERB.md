# Project FERB

FERB is an acronym for (Friendly. Educational. Repository. Bank of pets) and is a service for predictive success regarding a catered commitment to the breed of dog by expectations for training repetitions for a desired behavior. The end goal is a methodology of practice to predict the best fit for families. This is achieved by setting an encouraged commitment to expectations for adoption permanence.
